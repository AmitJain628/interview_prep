/*

Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u â†’ v), vertex u appears before vertex v in the ordering.

It is primarily used in:

Task scheduling (e.g., resolving dependencies)
Build systems (compiling source files in order)
Course prerequisite planning
