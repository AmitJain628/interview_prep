I have over nine years of experience in software development.

I started my career with small companies and startups. My first role was at MAQ, and later I joined Limecray, which was a B2B startup. To explain, companies like Zomato and Swiggy in India work on a B2C model, but Limecray focused on B2B. We built software solutions for restaurants, such as online ordering apps, POS billing systems, menu managers, and more.

The idea was to help restaurants reduce their dependency on Zomato and Swiggy, which charged very high commissions. With our solutions, restaurants could save on those commissions and provide a better experience to their customers. Big chains like Domino’s and McDonald’s already had their own apps, but smaller restaurants couldn’t afford to build one, so we created custom solutions for them. Many major restaurants at that time were using our platform.

Since we were a small team, I also worked on another important project. Back then, restaurants had to manage multiple dashboards—Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats, Foodpanda, and more. It was a hassle to monitor each one separately. We built a merge platform that integrated all these aggregators into a single dashboard. This allowed restaurant managers to handle orders, update menus, and manage everything from one place.

After that, I joined Deutsche Telekom. In 2018, they set up their development IDC, and I was among the first 10 members to join. Over time, the team grew from just 9 people to over 100+ by the time I left.

We built a large e-commerce platform from scratch, which was multi-tenant, multi-lingual, and multi-currency. Since each European country had its own language, currency, and requirements, we developed our own CMS—a mini Shopify-like system. It allowed country admins to toggle features and customize their apps on the fly.

I led the Shopping Cart Squad, responsible for the user journey from homepage to product details and checkout. We used React and TypeScript, and even built our own component library.

Then, I moved to Compass, a US-based real estate brokerage firm, and worked there for over three years. I joined them during COVID. In Compass, I worked in the Payment Stream. Compass had multiple verticals, each with its own payment system. We built a common payment SDK—a plug-and-play solution that all products could integrate with. Our team managed the full post-checkout journey: payments, order history, APIs, and UI components. We also used a micro front-end architecture. Unfortunately, due to the recession, Compass decided to shut down its IDC in India and laid off the entire team, including me.

Currently, I’m working at ADS, a UAE-based fintech company, in a remote role. I handle two main verticals: Onboarding and Insights.

In the Onboarding vertical, ADS provides trading platforms like ADS Trader, MT4, and MT5. To use them, users need to complete the onboarding process (forms, KYC documents, etc.). I managed that product and recently integrated UAE Pass—similar to India’s Aadhaar-based authentication. With UAE Pass, instead of uploading documents manually, we fetch verified documents (like passports) directly from the government system.

In the Insights vertical, we built a terminal for traders to track stocks and financial data. Users can view live prices, historical charts (using ChartIQ), and economic events. We aggregate data from multiple APIs, including Trading Central and other sources. This helps traders monitor markets, check confidence indicators, and make better decisions.





You are setting up a new GCC in India, and it’s still quite new.
From my personal experience, whenever a new development center is set up, the existing teams sometimes feel unhappy because they believe their work is being taken away.

At Addepar, since you have multiple teams, how are you planning to handle this condition?

I checked your LinkedIn profile—you were a VP at Oracle and a CTO at JP Morgan, both billion-dollar companies. What excites you about working at Addepar, and what growth opportunities do you see here?


We are in the AI era, and things are changing rapidly. But in wealth management, the most important asset is data, and you can’t compromise on its security. Since you are not using AI tools like GitHub Copilot due to data security concerns, how are you planning to integrate AI into your existing workflows without compromising security?
